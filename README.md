The program needs a file name for the input graph and an integer (0/1) to indicate if the input graph is to be considered undirected (0) or directed (1).
The program prints on standard output (stdout) the value for gamma for each vertex and in the standard error (stderr) the overall gamma value of the input graph and the vertices whose gamma is above a hardcoded threshold. Redirect the stdout to generate an easy to use dataset.
